# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!

## 🚀 Who Am I?

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a love for **programming**, technology, and problem-solving. I enjoy working with a variety of programming languages including `Python`, `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `C#`, and `PowerShell`.

### 👨‍🏫 Teaching Experience

I’ve worked as a **Programming Instructor** at **Centro Educativo Sor Maria Romero**, where I guided students in building applications using `Java` and `C#`, integrating them with databases using `SQL`. Teaching others to code and build real-world solutions was an incredibly rewarding experience.

### 💼 Current Role

I'm currently serving as a **SCIM Microsoft 365 Identity Tech Lead** for the **SCIM Managua** team. In this role, I provide technical guidance and support to engineers working on Microsoft 365-related identity issues. I specialize in managing and automating Microsoft 365 environments using **PowerShell** and the **Microsoft Graph SDK**.

### 🛠️ Projects and Contributions

One of my proudest projects is a curated repository showcasing examples and scripts for **managing Microsoft 365 tenants using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**. It’s a valuable resource for IT admins, engineers, and automation enthusiasts.
